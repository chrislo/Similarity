* Similarity

** Overview

A Ruby library for calculating the similarity between pieces of text
using a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%25E2%2580%2593idf][Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency]] method.

A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_of_words_model][bag of words]] model is used. Terms in the source documents are
downcased and punctuation is removed, but stemming is not currently
implemented.

This library was written to facilitate the creation of diagrams talked
about by Jonathan Stray in his [[http://jonathanstray.com/a-full-text-visualization-of-the-iraq-war-logs][full-text visualization of the Iraq War
Logs]] post. An example of how to generate a [[http://gephi.org/][Gephi]] compatible file
including labelling of nodes with key words is included in the
=examples= directory.

The library is written in pure-ruby for portability, and has not been
rigorously optimised. I'd be interested in any comments, suggestions
and patches for how to improve performance.

** Usage

: require 'similarity'
:
: corpus = Corpus.new
:
: doc1 = Document.new({:content=>"Broad powers for hacking inquiry"})
: doc2 = Document.new({:content=>"UK unemployment level falls again"})
: doc3 = Document.new({:content=>"NI riots leads to 26 arrests"})
:
: corpus << doc1
: corpus << doc2
: corpus << doc3
:
: similarity = corpus.similarity(doc1, doc2)

For more examples, see the =examples= directory.

** Todo
- Performance improvements
  - Switch to storing document vector spaces in sparse form, using linalg?
- (Optional) stemming of source terms

** Contributing
- Fork the project
- Send a pull request
- Don't touch the .gemspec, I'll do that when I release a new version
